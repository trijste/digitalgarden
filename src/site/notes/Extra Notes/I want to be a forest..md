#Poetry

# I want to be a forest.


Standing together
near my mother's house,
knee-deep in snow,

Taking pictures that
we want to show
how deep we are.

In the background, trees
my Grandfather planted
forty years ago

strain through my lens.
I complain to you
about my camera,

“Everything's all wrong.”
I make a film about a man
walking through the trees,

panning and zooming in
on a girl, on the Xs that mark
where the loggers will clear.

Streets crisscross paved inclines
in the city. Shadows
from a chain-link fence mark
the sidewalk by a school.

In the pictures I have, you stand
amid a wood of blurred Xs;
A camera covers your face.

I try to imagine the straight rows
reduced to stumps. Later,
the new growth coming in.

Someday all plantations will be extinct.
Someday all will be forest. Again
I try to focus, but it's wrong.

If I look too long, I see
Xs everywhere. Reflections
in your camera lens.

How do I tell you I want to stand
among trees, unmarked?
